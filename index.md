### CPSC 120 Labs

---

* #### Lab 6 
    Lab 6 was one of my favorites because it introduced me to how programming can be used to build the foundation for larger projects, including games. I enjoyed learning how to manipulate strings and create outputs that changed based on user input. This lab showed me how code can be both creative and technical, which made it especially fun and memorable.


* #### Lab 9 
    Lab 9 was enjoyable because it helped me understand how multiple files work together in a project. Before this lab, I didn’t fully understand how header files and implementation files connected. After completing it, I felt more confident working with larger codebases and organizing code in a way that makes programs easier to read, debug, and expand.


* #### Lab 10 
    Lab 10 stood out to me because it introduced randomness and animation, concepts I could see myself using in future personal projects. Learning how to generate random outcomes and visually display results helped me appreciate how many creative possibilities programming offers. This lab also made me more confident in experimenting with visual or interactive elements in my own code.
